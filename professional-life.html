        <p>Most of my professional career has been spent in
        the hospitality and restaurant industry where I have
        worked nearly every font-of-house position known, from
        hosting to management. I've enjoyed everything that 
        I've done and learned in those industries, but over 
        time I found myself craving more. Thus, I have found 
        myself in the world of software engineering. I still
        have a long to way to go and much to learn, but I have
        an insatiable thirst for knowledge. Cheers!
